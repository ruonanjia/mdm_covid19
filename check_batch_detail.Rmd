This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```


```{r}
setwd("E:/Ruonan/Projects in the lab/mdm_covid19/batch_detail")
# batch1 <- read.csv("Batch_3973824_batch_results.csv")
# batch2 <- read.csv("Batch_3983151_batch_results.csv")
# batch3 <- read.csv("Batch_3991931_batch_results.csv")
# batch4 <- read.csv("Batch_3999031_batch_results.csv")
# batch5 <- read.csv("Batch_4003124_batch_results.csv")
# batch6 <- read.csv("Batch_4006085_batch_results.csv")

batch7 <- read.csv("Batch_4012287_batch_results.csv")

```

```{r}
colnames(batch7)
batch7$Answer.surveycode

is.element(batch7$Answer.surveycode, data.batch$mTurkCode)

batch7$Answer.surveycode[2]
```


```{r}
colnames(batch2)
nrow(batch6)

# combine data
batch <- rbind(batch1, batch2,batch3,batch4,batch5,batch6)
nrow(batch)
View(batch)
```

# check duplication of worker ID
```{r}
colnames(batch)
batch$WorkerId

id.duplicate <- batch$WorkerId[duplicated(batch$WorkerId)]
length(id.duplicate)
time.duplicate <- data.frame(batch$AcceptTime[is.element(batch$WorkerId, id.duplicate)], batch$WorkerId[is.element(batch$WorkerId, id.duplicate)])
View(time.duplicate)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
